HOW TO RUN :
run generateData.py(adjust for training testing proportion of data) to generate trainData.txt and testData.txt
set value of boolean graphemeTophoneme [line 2 train.py]
run ./test.py

Output is each line followed by output given by program

Code Explanation :
Initially code was written to convert grapheme to phoneme,
But later phoneme to grapheme was also done. So everything is kept same for training, only variables are reversed. One which used to store phonemes/phonemes-data now stores graphemes/graphemes-data.
